# DOGGY RESCUE 

![alt text](https://github.com/DannyNagyAI/Code-Institute-Milestone-Project-01/blob/main/img/doggy_rescue_teaser.jpg "Header of the Homepage")

>This website was made for a fictive **(Doggy Rescue Center)** in Nerja - Spain, that was in great need of buliding a basic functional website.  

The website displays information about the rescued dogs and their situation in Spain, it also has some information about the rescue center, directions, a page for users to view the available dogs that are in need of help and also a contact page with more information about the adoption process and a form to be able to make the audience/users take contact on their first step in the process of adopting a dog. 

My idea was to build the website with a simple and clean user usability and that also had some ingridients that could **(warm up peoples hearts)** in a way that make them feel more caring for the dogs on the website. 

## User Experience (UX)
The idea for this project was to build a static front-end website for a Dog Rescue Center in Spain. 

The Dog Rescue Center is interested in getting more people involved in the center, to both help and also to get more friendly people to adopt and help their dogs in need. 

The audience for this website are people that care about and love dogs all over the world, and the purpose is to make them either share some information from the website or hopefully adopt the dogs themself. 

**To be able to help the Doggy Rescue with their needs, I had to include:**
- A simple way of navigating around the page. 
- Infomation about their history and the Doggy Rescue center. 
- Infomation about their location. 
- Showcase photos of dogs in needs to motivate people to visit and share with their friends. 
- Provide detail information about the dogs and the adoption process.  
- A contact section with a form. 

>I tried to stay on the same path during the entire project with both colors and pictures.

### Issues/problems/improvements
No known bugs or bigger problems, however some minor things should be fixed: 
- The "active" menu-item, when you scroll on page, the active button stops to indicate which page your on (you can still navigate, but active indicator doest not appear active).
- The form on the contact page is not perfect, might need some adjustments like width of form elements. Also future version might also contain functionality on serverside to actually sending a email message. Probably we will use Python (or Java) language to parse the posted form content.
- Hero images should be resized to less height, in order to view more of the page content at first glance.
